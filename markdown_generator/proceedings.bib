    abstract="Computer vision has a wide and diverse range of applications nowadays. A particular one is automatic detection of parking lot occupancy, where a computer has to identify whether a parking lot space is empty or occupied. As in any visual classification problem, detecting parking lot spaces relies on the existence of a representative visual dataset. This problem of binary classification is commonly approached using features with adequate level of invariance to changes in illumination or rotation, that allow feeding these features into classifiers such as the SVM. Most used approaches are based on the use of convolutional neural networks, some times based on pre-trained models which in general have quite high performance. however several of these methods are tested with common experiments that do not take into account the variations that occur when training with different combinations of angles, lighting variations, and weather types. That is why in this paper we present a comparison between two approaches to solve the problem of parking lot classification with two methods: Convolutional Neural Networks and Bag of Features. In this paper we show how to use the standard Bag-of-features model to learn a visual dictionary, and use it to classify empty and occupied spaces. Results are compared with CNN approaches, emphasizing on accuracy, sensitivity analysis, and execution time.",

    abstract="We present a superpixel-based strategy for segmenting skin lesion on dermoscopic images. The segmentation is carried out by over-segmenting the original image using the SLIC algorithm, and then merge the resulting superpixels into two regions: healthy skin and lesion. The mean RGB color of each superpixel was used as merging criterion. The presented method is capable of dealing with segmentation problems commonly found in dermoscopic images such as hair removal, oil bubbles, changes in illumination, and reflections images without any additional steps. The method was evaluated on the PH2 and ISIC 2017 dataset with results comparable to the state-of-art.",

	Abstract = {The cattle (Bos taurus) genome was originally selected for sequencing due to its economic importance and unique biology as a model organism for understanding other ruminants, or mammals. Currently, there are two cattle genome sequence assemblies (UMD3.1 and Btau4.6) from groups using dissimilar assembly algorithms, which were complemented by genetic and physical map resources. However, past comparisons between these assemblies revealed substantial differences. Consequently, such discordances have engendered ambiguities when using reference sequence data, impacting genomic studies in cattle and motivating construction of a new optical map resource--BtOM1.0--to guide comparisons and improvements to the current sequence builds. Accordingly, our comprehensive comparisons of BtOM1.0 against the UMD3.1 and Btau4.6 sequence builds tabulate large-to-immediate scale discordances requiring mediation.},
